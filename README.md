This blog is born out of necessity as current views on the military are seemingly inadequate in both the amateur side and more on the professional fighting side as well. The content of this channel are strictly related to military matters and exploration of ideas that challenge the conventional wisdom, is also not limited to the analysis of current procurement decision and tactical decision. Simply put, this channel isn't born to compare statistics but to weight the decision/equipment in question to their abillity to fit in its own CONOPS and how it fits in the overall strategy. Viewers are expected to have basic grasp of military history and tactics and understand common senses, a lot of our "advanced" ideas are simple and straight forward, serving to dispel the military's tendency of wishful thinking without regards actual combat effectiveness!
