[{"content":"Follow the footsteps of ComNavOps before me, I wanted this blog to be dedicated to all military matters in the warfighting department. We have recently seen military projects getting delayed to extended periods of time at the cost of our combat readiness, we also have seen colossally overbudget projects that failed to meet expectations.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to reexamine the way we fight and ask the real question that needs to be addressed: \u0026ldquo;Is what we doing here preventing the next war?\u0026rdquo;. History is screaming at us with lessons that we somehow has forgotten nowadays!\nTo prove my point, Edmund Burke has famously once said: \u0026ldquo;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u0026rdquo; Which side of history are you on right now?\n","date":"2020-08-23","permalink":"https://DefenseCaseAnalysis.github.io/post/placeholder-text/","tags":["Welcome"],"title":"DCA is here! Give him a warm welcome guys!"}]
